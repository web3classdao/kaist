# Building Web3 & Blockchain Applications
## KAIST, Spring 2023 {: .text-grey-lt-300 }

This course deals with developing Web3/Blockchain apps. It is conducted in English and is an online class. It is for KAIST students, but external listeners can also take the course through online application. As a final assignment, you need to create a Web3 app prototype or submit a Web3 business plan. It is operated as a web3-style class community, not a one-way class. Through a Discord community, students, professors, invited speakers, and expert mentors aim for an all-round class where they learn and inspire each other.

## Course Overview

- Course Title: Building Web3 & Blockchain Applications (CS492 Special Topics in Computer Science)
- Course Type: Major Elective
- Credit: 3
- Hours: 16:00 – 19:00 Wednesdays (8 March - 7 June)
- Place: Online Zoom
- Language: English
- Professors: Jaesun Han, Min Suk Kang, Sukyoung Ryu

## Course Introduction

Blockchain is a disruptive technology that can increase the transparency of information and give trust between transaction parties. By utilizing these characteristics, many trust issues in modern society can be solved. In addition, the Web3 app, which grants data ownership to users, can solve the data monopoly issue of platform companies. In this class, we will expand the scope of blockchain use, which is currently concentrated on cryptocurrency, and explore ways to solve various social problems and global challenges. Web3 apps are different from developing existing Internet applications. Since smart contract codes are written in the blockchain, transparency and trust can be improved, while security and code audit become more important. And since applications implemented as an open protocol are accessible without permission, web3 apps can be developed as if assembling Lego blocks. Web3 forms a community where all participants are the owners of the service. Therefore, designing and programming an incentive model and a governance model is a crucial task to ensure community-centered operation. 
The following topics will be covered:

- Web3/Blockchain basics
- Blockchain technology fundamentals and advanced topics
- Web3/Blockchain application architecture and programming
- Web3/Blockchain building blocks: cryptocurrency, DeFi, NFT, DAO, GameFi, X2E and more
- Solving social problems and global challenges with Web3/Blockchain

### Goals

- The goal of this class is to help students understand the basic concepts and technologies of blockchain and web3, learn how to develop new blockchain/web3 applications, and use them in practice. 
- Students will experience web3 building blocks such as NFT, DAO, and DeFi, and learn recent blockchain research topics such as L2 and ZKP. 
- In particular, domestic and foreign experts working in the blockchain industry will be invited to share their practical knowledge. Finally, students can gain experience in planning web3 apps or developing prototypes. 

## Course Grading

Pass / Fail (S/U Grades only; no letter grades)
- Each student chooses from a Web3 app prototype or a Web3 startup proposal.
- “Pass” will be given only when a student demonstrates a complete Web3 app prototype (Option 1) or presents a promising Web3 startup proposal (Option 2).
- Attendance alone does not guarantee “Pass”.

Option 1. Web3 app prototype 
- Building a Web3 app prototype with Solidity smart contracts and web frontend.
- Using EVM-compatible blockchains like Ethereum, Klaytn, Polygon, L2, etc.
- Running the Web3 app prototype.

Option 2. Web3 startup proposal
- Planning a Web3 app and building an architecture of the Web3 app.
- Proposing an incentive model and a governance scheme for a target community.
- Writing a pitch deck to found a Web3 startup.

## Just the Class

Just the Class is a GitHub Pages template developed for the purpose of quickly deploying course websites. In addition to serving plain web pages and files, it provides a boilerplate for:

- [announcements](announcements.md),
- a [course calendar](calendar.md),
- a [staff](staff.md) page,
- and a weekly [schedule](schedule.md).

Just the Class is a template that extends the popular [Just the Docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs) theme, which provides a robust and thoroughly-tested foundation for your website. Just the Docs include features such as:

- automatic [navigation structure](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/navigation-structure/),
- instant, full-text [search](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/search/) and page indexing,
- and a set of [UI components](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/ui-components) and authoring [utilities](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/utilities).

## Getting Started

Getting started with Just the Class is simple.

1. Create a [new repository based on Just the Class](https://github.com/kevinlin1/just-the-class/generate).
1. Update `_config.yml` and `README.md` with your course information. [Be sure to update the url and baseurl](https://mademistakes.com/mastering-jekyll/site-url-baseurl/).
1. Configure a [publishing source for GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages). Your course website is now live!
1. Edit and create `.md` [Markdown files](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to add more content pages.

Just the Class has been used by instructors at Stanford University ([CS 161](https://stanford-cs161.github.io/winter2021/)), UC Berkeley ([Data 100](https://ds100.org/fa21/)), UC Santa Barbara ([CSW8](https://ucsb-csw8.github.io/s22/)), Northeastern University ([CS4530/5500](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-CS5500-Spring-2021/)), and Carnegie Mellon University ([17-450/17-950](https://cmu-crafting-software.github.io/)). Share your course website and find more examples in the [show and tell discussion](https://github.com/kevinlin1/just-the-class/discussions/categories/show-and-tell)!

### Local development environment
